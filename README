EGCS-JVM is a reboot of Trent Waddington's JVM backend for EGCS, which
makes it possible to compile C sources to JVM byte code. 

The goal of the present project is to complete the compiler and add more convenient
builder system that makes it possible to seamlessly integrate legacy C code with 
JVM based systems.

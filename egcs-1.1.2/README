BUILDING

./configure jvm
make cross

The build should run for a bit and then fail; this is "normal", but you
should be able to execute the cc1 and cpp binaries in gcc/

The cc1 compiler will produce output in jasmin assembly language. This
is used in turn as input to the EgcsBuilder class in the egcs-jvm-builder
module, which will combine the assembly output into a single class file.
